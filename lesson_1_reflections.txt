How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I think its nice

But maybe not

Thank you

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

With google drive
and dropboix

thank you

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros : I decide
Cons : Might forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
its depending on the final use of the file.

Because its nice

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

i can go back
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git diff
